Harry Potter is a wizard. He is in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It's always a relief after summer with the Dursleys, however, Harry doesn't realise that this year will be just as eventful as the last two! The atmosphere at Hogwarts is tense. There's an escaped mass murderer on the loose, even the Muggles have been warned. The sinister prison guards of Azkaban have been called in to guard the school and Harry, Ron and Hermione rapidly discover why all witches and wizards live in fear of being sent to Azkaban. Lessons, however, must go on and there are lots of new subjects in third year – Care of Magical Creatures and Divination among others. Plus the delights of Hogsmeade, the only village in the UK entirely populated by the magical community.","author":"Daniel Keyes","imgUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1486131451i/853510.jpg","categories":["Зарубежная литература"],"ageRestriction":13,"complexity":"junior","rating":3,"user":{"_id":"656b2db5beea959a8363a266","fullName":"Glebabasta","email":"erichkrause2012@tut.by","isAdmin":true,"passwordHash":"$2b$10$DomimI1T9hQKGCjgrbC8o.9teKSX1/0Y.3fOyl7IBbhGOFlnIM3VK","createdAt":"2023-12-02T13:14:29.161Z","updatedAt":"2023-12-02T13:14:29.161Z","__v":0},"provider":{"_id":"66573c7f9ef7da5bd81527da","providerName":"Новый поставщик 2","providerStatus":true,"email":"kek@tut.by","contactPerson":"Андрей","workingConditions":"1 раз в месяц","createdAt":"2024-05-29T14:32:31.789Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-29T14:32:31.789Z","__v":0},"createdAt":"2024-05-29T14:31:51.684Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-29T14:35:25.349Z","__v":0},{"_id":"66819bae38f35b1793301509","title":"Гарри Поттер","price":10,"deliveryPrice":6,"storeCount":4,"saleCount":1,"sales":[{"dateOfSale":"30.06.2024","yearOfSale":2024,"monthOfSale":6,"dayOfSale":30,"saleCount":1}],"orderCount":0,"orders":[],"description":"Jane Eyre is one of the great romantic heroines of world literature. Orphaned into cold charity at the hands of her rich cousins and, later, at Lowood School, Jane escapes to take up a position as governess to the young ward of Mr Rochester. Their love affair, Jane's discovery of Rochester's secret – hideously concealed in the attic of Thornfield Hall – and her desperate flight are told in a drama of passionate intensity whose pace never slackens.  \"Jane Eyre\" is a love story with a happy ending, rare in its time for its sympathetic portrayal of the love of a married man for another woman. It is, as Thackeray said, \"The masterwork of a great genius\".","author":"Артемий","imgUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1486131451i/853510.jpg","categories":["Зарубежная литература"],"ageRestriction":12,"complexity":"junior","rating":2,"user":{"_id":"656b2db5beea959a8363a266","fullName":"Glebabasta","email":"erichkrause2012@tut.by","isAdmin":true,"passwordHash":"$2b$10$DomimI1T9hQKGCjgrbC8o.9teKSX1/0Y.3fOyl7IBbhGOFlnIM3VK","createdAt":"2023-12-02T13:14:29.161Z","updatedAt":"2023-12-02T13:14:29.161Z","__v":0},"provider":{"_id":"66058389d67cf813f1df35dd","providerName":"Оптима Трейд","providerStatus":true,"email":"kek@tut.by","contactPerson":"Дмитрий Кулик","workingConditions":"По запросу","createdAt":"2024-03-28T14:49:45.087Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-28T14:49:45.087Z","__v":0},"createdAt":"2024-06-30T17:53:50.231Z","updatedAt":"2024-06-30T18:02:33.785Z","__v":0}]
