Orphaned into cold charity at the hands of her rich cousins and, later, at Lowood School, Jane escapes to take up a position as governess to the young ward of Mr Rochester. Their love affair, Jane's discovery of Rochester's secret – hideously concealed in the attic of Thornfield Hall – and her desperate flight are told in a drama of passionate intensity whose pace never slackens.  \"Jane Eyre\" is a love story with a happy ending, rare in its time for its sympathetic portrayal of the love of a married man for another woman. It is, as Thackeray said, \"The masterwork of a great genius\".","author":"Joanne Rowling","imgUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1689071681i/18373.jpg","categories":["Дизайн и искусство"],"ageRestriction":13,"complexity":"middle+","rating":5,"user":{"_id":"656b2db5beea959a8363a266","fullName":"Glebabasta","email":"erichkrause2012@tut.by","isAdmin":true,"passwordHash":"$2b$10$DomimI1T9hQKGCjgrbC8o.9teKSX1/0Y.3fOyl7IBbhGOFlnIM3VK","createdAt":"2023-12-02T13:14:29.161Z","updatedAt":"2023-12-02T13:14:29.161Z","__v":0},"provider":{"_id":"65c11c89214e2d64a50a9799","providerName":"Оптима Трейд","providerStatus":true,"email":"optima@tut.by","contactPerson":"Дмитрий Петров","workingConditions":"Поставки 2 раза в неделю.","createdAt":"2024-02-05T17:36:09.924Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-05T17:36:09.924Z","__v":0},"createdAt":"2024-02-23T17:52:11.084Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-09T19:08:50.076Z","__v":0}]
